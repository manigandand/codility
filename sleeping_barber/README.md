## Sleeping Barber Problem

The barber has one barber's chair in a cutting room and a waiting room containing a number of chairs in it.

When the barber finishes cutting a customer's hair, he dismisses the customer and goes to the waiting room to see if there are others waiting.

If there are, he brings one of them back to the chair and cuts their hair. If there are none, he returns to the chair and sleeps in it.

Each customer, when they arrive, looks to see what the barber is doing.

- If the barber is sleeping, the customer wakes him up and sits in the cutting room chair.
- If the barber is cutting hair, the customer stays in the waiting room.
- If there is a free chair in the waiting room, the customer sits in it and waits their turn.
- If there is no free chair, the customer leaves.
